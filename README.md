my first ever actual coding project. its a discord bot that basically acts as rude as possible to anyone and everyone. also, i was planning to make it ping people every day at 4:20 P.M. (this information is indicative to my mental age)
also i have virtually zero experience in python, and i am literally learning as i go in order to cobble this bot together, forgive me for my nonexistent style
hopefully this is enough to expand my brain size and set me on the path of becoming a decent developer coder man guy dude thing yeahhhh
