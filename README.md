my first ever actual coding project. its a discord bot that basically acts as rude as possible to anyone and everyone. also, i was planning to make it ping people every day at 4:20 P.M. (this information is indicative to my mental age). quick disclaimer, i have virtually zero experience in python, and i am literally learning as i go in order to cobble this bot together, so forgive me for my nonexistent style. hopefully this is enough to expand my brain size and set me on the path of becoming a decent developer coder man guy dude thing. yeaaahhhhh. 

oh yeah and if you're wondering if im insane, the story is that i played doki doki literature club once and thought it was cool. that's all there is. i swear.
